User Guide
==========

First a short warning: the term 'user guide' might be a bit misleading: 
this part of the documentation simply covers everything but what is documented directly in the source - 
the latter can be found in the :doc:`reference`.

Library overview
----------------
The root directory of this git repository contains the following folders:

tenpy
    The actual source code of the library.
    Every subfolder contains an ``__init__.py`` file with a summary what the modules in it are good for.
    (This file is also necessary to mark the folder as part of the python package.
    Consequently, other subfolders of the git repo should not include a ``__init__.py`` file.)
toycodes
    Simple toy codes completely independet of the remaining library (i.e., codes in ``tenpy/``).
    These codes should be quite readable and intend to give a flavor of how (some of) the algorithms work.
examples
    Some example files demonstrating the usage and interface of the library.
doc
    A folder containing the documentation: the user guide is contained in the ``*.rst`` files.
    The online documentation is autogenerated from these files and the docstrings of the library.
    This folder contains a make file for building the documentation, run ``make help`` for the different options.
    The necessary files for the reference in ``doc/reference`` can be auto-generated/updated with ``make src2html``.
tests
    Contains files with test routines, to be used with `pytest`.
    If you are set up correctly and have `pytest` installed, you can run the test suite with
    ``pytest`` from within the ``tests/`` folder.
build
    This folder is not distributed with the code, but is generated by ``setup.py`` (or ``compile.sh``, respectively).
    It contains compiled versions of the Cython files, and can be ignored (and even removed without loosing functionality).
