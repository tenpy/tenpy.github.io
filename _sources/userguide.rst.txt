User Guide
==========

First a short warning: the term 'user guide' might be a bit misleading: 
this part of the documentation simply covers everything but what is documented directly in the source - 
the latter can be found in the :doc:`reference`.

The first step to use tenpy is to download and install it; simply follow the :doc:`INSTALL`.

After that, take a look at the :doc:`overview` to get started.
