Advanced examples
=================

The following "advanced examples" are included in the TeNPy repository in the folder ``examples/advanced``, 
we include them here in the documentation for reference.
Theses "advanced examples" go beyond the basic usage of the algorithm, but can give you an idea for certain tasks.
It's a somewhat random collection, feel free to suggest further examples.
