Toy Codes
=========

The following "toy codes" are included in the TeNPy repository in the folder ``toycodes/``, 
we include them here in the documentation for reference.
They are meant to give you a flavor of the different algorithms,
while keeping the codes as readable and simple as possible.
The only requirements to run them are Python 3, Numpy, and Scipy. 
Simply go to the folder where you downloaded them, and execute them with python.
