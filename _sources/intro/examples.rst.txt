Example codes
=============

The following "examples" are included in the TeNPy repository in the folder ``examples/``, 
we include them here in the documentation for reference.
Theses examples are meant to give an idea how to use the library and demonstrate parts of the interface.
It might be helpful to compare some of them (e.g., `c_tebd.py` and `d_dmrg.py`) to the :doc:`/intro/toycodes`.
To run these examples, you have to have TeNPy installed, see :doc:`/INSTALL`.
You do not need to save the examples inside the tenpy folder/repository, but you can execute them from anywhere (if
TeNPy is installed correctly).
