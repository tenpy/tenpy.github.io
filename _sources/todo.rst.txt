To-Do list
==========

Primary goals for the coming release
------------------------------------
- finish documentation and tests on existing stuff


Concrete things to be fixed in different files
----------------------------------------------
- The MPO class has no function for expectation value with MPS
- Since we switched to python 3 completely, there's no need to subclass 'object' anymore.
- npc.Array: comparison with ==, pickle, hashable?
- MPS class: group_sites, split_sites, pad
- MPS class: probability_per_charge, charge_variance
- MPS class: string correlation function


To be done at some point for the next releases
----------------------------------------------
- remove this file: use GitHub issues instead
- overview and usage introduction to the overall library
- trace: allow multiple axes to be traced over; optimize
- Summary of defined classes/functions at the beginning of a module in the reference
- Inconsistency: `NearestNeighborModel.H_bond` with ``bc_MPS='infinite'`` has bonds ``[(L, 0), (0, 1), ...]``, 
  but :class:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.expectation_value()` takes two-site operators on bonds ``[(0, 1), (1, 2), ...(L,0)]``.


Wish-list
---------
- logging mechanism?
- Johannes Motruk: extend simulation class: save standard variables like entropy, energy, etc?
- Ruben: extend MPS TransferMatrix class
- Jakob: function for Arrays: Perfrom trace over multiple pairs of legs at once. Tracing one after the other calculates unnecessary "off-diagonal" elements.

Auto-generated To-Do list
-------------------------
The following list is auto-generated by sphinx, extracting ``.. todo ::`` blocks from doc-strings of the code.
