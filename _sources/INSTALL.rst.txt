Installation instructions
=========================

There are several ways to install TeNPy.

A very comfortable way is to use ``pip install``, as described in :doc:`/install/pip`.

The method with the minimal requirements is to just download the source and adjust the `PYTHONPATH`, 
as described in :doc:`/install/from_source`. This is also the recommended way if you plan to modify parts of the source.

.. If you read this file in raw-text, look at the files in the doc/install/ subfolder 
   of the repository for the different methods to install TeNPy.
