TeNPy: Tensor Network Python
----------------------------

TeNPy (short for 'Tensor Network Python') is a Python library for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum systems with tensor networks.

The philosophy of this library is to get a new balance of a good readability and usability for new-comers, and at the same time powerful algorithms and fast development of new algorithms for experts.
For good readability, we include an extensive documentation next to the code, both in Python doc strings and separately as "user guides", as well as simple example codes and even toy codes, which just demonstrate various algorithms (like TEBD and DMRG) in ~100 lines per file.
